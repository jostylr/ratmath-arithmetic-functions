Synthetic Division - ArithFuns Package

Efficient polynomial division by linear factors (x - c).

FUNCTIONS:
  SynthDiv(P, c)            - Divide P by (x - c), return {quotient, remainder}
  SynthDiv(P, c, 1)         - Include step-by-step work
  SynthDivPoly(P, c)        - Return just the quotient polynomial
  SynthDivRem(P, c)         - Return just the remainder (= P(c))
  SynthDivSteps(P, c)       - Return detailed step structure

TAYLOR POLYNOMIAL (REBASING):
  PolyRebase(P, a)          - Express P(x) as polynomial in (x - a)
  PolyTaylor(P, a)          - Same as PolyRebase
  PolyRebaseSteps(P, a)     - Show repeated synthetic division process

HOW IT WORKS:
  Synthetic division divides P(x) by (x - c) efficiently.
  The remainder equals P(c) by the Remainder Theorem.
  
  To rebase at x = a, apply synthetic division repeatedly:
  Each application extracts one Taylor coefficient.

STEP OUTPUT FORMAT:
  SynthDivSteps returns:
  {
    divisor: c,
    coeffs: {aₙ, ..., a₁, a₀},   # descending for display
    rows: {...},                  # intermediate calculations
    quotient: Poly(...),
    remainder: P(c)
  }

EXAMPLES:
  P := Poly({-6, 11, -6, 1})     # x³ - 6x² + 11x - 6 = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3)
  
  SynthDiv(P, 1)
  → {quotient: Poly({6, -5, 1}), remainder: 0}
  
  SynthDivRem(P, 2)              → 0 (since x=2 is a root)
  
  # Rebase x³ at a = 1: (x-1)³ + 3(x-1)² + 3(x-1) + 1
  PolyRebase(Poly({0, 0, 0, 1}), 1)
  → Poly({1, 3, 3, 1})           # coefficients of (x-1)^k

APPLICATIONS:
  1. Finding rational roots (test candidates)
  2. Factoring polynomials
  3. Taylor polynomial computation
  4. Horner's method (synthetic eval is one row)
  5. Partial fraction setup

NOTES:
  - Synthetic division only works for linear divisors (x - c)
  - For general polynomial division, use PolyDiv
  - The remainder is always P(c) - this is the Remainder Theorem
  - Step output shows traditional synthetic division layout
