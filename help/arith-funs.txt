QUICK START:
  LOAD arith-funs

  # Create polynomial: 1 + 2x + 3x²
  P := Poly({1, 2, 3})
  PolyEval(P, 2)           → 17

  # Synthetic division by (x - 3)
  SynthDiv(P, 3)           → {quotient, remainder}

  # Number theory
  Gcd(24, 36)              → 12
  Factor(60)               → {2, 2, 3, 5}
  IsPrime(17)              → 1

HELP TOPICS:
  HELP polynomial          - Polynomial operations
  HELP synth-div           - Synthetic division details
  HELP number-theory       - Number-theoretic functions
  HELP rational-func       - Rational function operations
  HELP piecewise           - Piecewise and step functions

NOTES:
  - Polynomials use ascending coefficient order: {a₀, a₁, a₂, ...}
  - Many functions accept optional showSteps parameter for detailed output
  - Use decorations to inspect polynomial properties: Get(P, "degree")
